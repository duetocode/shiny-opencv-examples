# shiny-opencv-examples

OpenCV C++ examples. Using CMake as build tool.

## Background

This is a playground for learning OpenCV in C++ as the project I am working on requires me to write some components in C++ to meet the performance standard. Therefore, I decided to learn on the fly because I have zero experience on boath C++ and OpenCV.

## Build & Environment

First, we need OpenCV installed as shared library. The recommended version is 4.3.0. 
To build and run the examples, CMake and working C++ toolchain should be properly installed and configured. I use clang as my compiler since most of the time, I use macbook to write the code. But the program is meant to run on ARM CPUs like raspberry pi or rk3399pro.
